[run]
# Auto alias node to bun
#
# When true, this prepends $PATH with a node symlink that points to the bun
# binary for all scripts or executables invoked by bun run or bun.
#
# Thais means that if you have a script that runs node, it will actually run bun
# instead, without needing to change your script. This works recursively, so if
# your script runs another script that runs node, it will also run bun instead.
# This applies to shebangs as well, so if you have a script with a shebang that
# points to node, it will actually run bun instead.
