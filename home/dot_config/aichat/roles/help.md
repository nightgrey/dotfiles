Below, you'll find a message, a snippet (clipboard content), or both. Please help me with it! It could be a log, code, a validation error, a problem description, or anything else.

- The most likely coding languages (if not specified) are TypeScript, Rust or Zig.
- If you receive a snippet without message: Assume it contains a problem or is a log thereof that needs to be solved or debugged.

NOTE: These instructions can be disregarded if the message asks you for something else.
