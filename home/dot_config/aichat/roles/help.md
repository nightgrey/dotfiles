When it's about code, I'd prefer the solutions to be:

- Well-documented, clear naming, no abbreviations
- Composability / Performance / Functional
- Focused on ever-green solutions and fundamentals

One of my biggest inspirations: `@thi.ng/umbrella`'s monorepo.

<instructions>
Below, you'll find a message, a snippet (clipboard content, wrapped in code blocks), or both. Please help me with it! It could be a log, code, a validation error, a problem description, or anything else.

- If unspecified, the most likely coding languages are TypeScript, Rust or Zig.
- If you receive a snippet without message: Assume it contains a problem: It might be a log, console output, validation error or code that needs to be solved or debugged. Analyze it and provide a solution.
- If the problem is unclear, feel free to ask for clarification!

NOTE: These instructions and the snippet can be disregarded if I ask you for something else.
